# Football League Match Results Analysis: Detailed Project Plan

## Project Summary
In this project, I will analyze match results from football leagues to investigate the home advantage phenomenon in football. Using the Football-data.org API, I will collect comprehensive data from major European leagues and process it through various analytical methods to determine the extent and conditions of home field advantage. I will statistically analyze whether home teams truly have a significant advantage in terms of wins, goals scored, and other performance metrics.

## Motivation
Football is a sport followed by billions of people worldwide, and the concept of home advantage is one of the most discussed phenomena in sports. This project offers an opportunity to test this popular football theory with real data and quantify its actual impact. This study allows me to apply my data science skills to real-world data and gain an in-depth understanding in the field of sports analytics.

## Data Source
The Football-data.org API is a free data source providing comprehensive football data from various European leagues and tournaments. This API provides the following data:
- Match results and fixtures
- Team rosters and player statistics
- Detailed match statistics (shots, corners, cards, etc.)
- Referee information
- Stadium and spectator numbers
- Betting odds (to show pre-match favorites)

## Data to be Collected
I will create a dataset covering the last 5 seasons of the five major European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1). For each match, I will collect the following data:

### Basic Match Information:
- Date and time
- Home team and away team
- Score (half-time and full-time)
- League and season

### Detailed Match Statistics:
- Shots (on/off target)
- Corner kicks
- Yellow and red cards
- Ball possession percentage
- Pass count and success rate

### Additional Information:
- Stadium and spectator count
- Teams' league positions that week
- Whether the stadium was at full capacity or had attendance restrictions

## Analysis Plan

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Write a Python script to connect to the Football-data.org API
- Clean the data and handle missing values
- Standardize data from different leagues
- Structure the data for home vs. away performance analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Win percentages for home vs. away teams across leagues
- Goal distribution for home vs. away teams
- Performance metrics comparison (shots, possession, etc.)
- Visual analysis of home advantage trends over time
- Home advantage variation across different leagues

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Chi-square tests for win/loss/draw distributions
- T-tests comparing home vs. away team performance metrics
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA) across different leagues
- Multiple regression to identify factors contributing to home advantage
- Time series analysis to detect any trends or changes in home advantage over seasons

### 4. Visualization and Presentation of Results
- Home vs. away win percentage bar charts
- Goal difference distributions
- League comparison visualizations
- Time series plots showing home advantage trends
- Interactive dashboard summarizing key findings

## Hypothesis

### Home Advantage Hypothesis:
- **H₀**: Home teams do not have a statistically significant advantage compared to away teams in terms of match outcomes, goals scored, and performance metrics.
- **H₁**: Home teams win more matches, score more goals, and show better performance metrics compared to away teams.

## Expected Results and Outputs
1. Comprehensive analysis of the real extent of home advantage across major European leagues
2. Identification of factors that may strengthen or weaken the home advantage (e.g., crowd size, travel distance)
3. Comparative analysis of how home advantage varies across different leagues
4. Investigation of whether home advantage has changed over time or was affected by events like pandemic-era empty stadiums
5. Interactive visualizations demonstrating key findings about home advantage

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data collection, cleaning, and analysis
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- NumPy: For numerical calculations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For basic visualizations
- Plotly: For interactive visualizations
- SciPy and Statsmodels: For statistical analyses
- Requests: For API calls
- Jupyter Notebook: For code development and presentation of results

## Timeline
1. Data Collection and Cleaning (1 week): Extracting data from API and preparing the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (1 week): Basic statistics and visualizations of home advantage patterns
3. Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis (2 weeks): Testing the home advantage hypothesis with various statistical methods
4. Advanced Analyses (1 week): Investigating factors that influence home advantage
5. Interpretation of Results and Reporting (1 week): Compilation and presentation of findings

## Potential Challenges and Solutions
1. Data Quality and Consistency: Data from the API may be missing or inconsistent. I can solve this by integrating different data sources if needed.
2. API Limitations: The free API of Football-data.org may have request limits. Collecting data gradually and storing it locally can mitigate this issue.
3. Confounding Variables: Multiple factors may influence home advantage simultaneously. I will use multivariate analysis to account for these interactions.
4. COVID-19 Impact: The pandemic created a unique situation with matches played without spectators. I will analyze this period separately to examine how lack of crowd affects home advantage.

## Conclusion
This project will help us better understand the home advantage phenomenon in football through comprehensive data analysis. By focusing on this single, well-defined hypothesis, I can conduct a thorough investigation that provides meaningful insights. The results will be of interest to football enthusiasts, sports analysts, and data science students alike, potentially challenging or confirming long-held beliefs about the importance of playing at home.
